## Documenting your project using markdown   

It is always very helful to include a `README.md` file at the root of your project.  Typically this file includes things like:    
* Project Name and Description      
* Any Prerequisites needed for working with your project     
* Helpful notes and rules     
* etc...     
         
There are lots of useful cheatsheets out there for markdown syntax.  Check [this](https://github.com/knoyerl/Standard-Hello-World-/tree/feature/brad) one out, for example.
